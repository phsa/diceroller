### Dice Roller from Udacity's Android free course

A simple Dice Roller app. A little bit different from the original. 

The differences are: 
- keeping the *ConstraintLayout*, instead of changing to *LinearLayout*, and then using bias to place the elements; 
- using ViewBinding to rid of findViewByIds; 
- replacement of original colors and 
- a customization for the button tha uses a rounded shape.
