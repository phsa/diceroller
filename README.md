### Dice Roller from Udacity's Android free course

A simple Dice Roller app. A little bit different from the original from the Udacity's "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin". 

The differences are: 
- keeping the *ConstraintLayout*, instead of changing to *LinearLayout*, and then using bias to place the elements; 
- using ViewBinding to get rid of findViewByIds; 
- replacement of original colors; 
- using a rounded shape for the button;
- a new launch icon;
- an *activity_main.xml* for land configuration;
- using *ViewModel* and *LiveData*;
- storing the dice resources in a *hashMap*.
